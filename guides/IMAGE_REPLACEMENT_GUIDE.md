# Image Replacement Instructions

Based on the photos you provided, please replace these files with the corresponding images:

## 1. Main Profile Image (Large center image)
**File:** `public/pictures/mohamed-profile.jpg`
**Replace with:** The close-up selfie photo (the one that looks best as a main portrait)

## 2. Workspace Image (Bottom-left floating card)
**File:** `public/pictures/hero-workspace.jpg`  
**Replace with:** The first attachment - the workspace/desk photo showing your setup

## 3. Outdoor Selfie (Top-right circular image)
**File:** `public/pictures/hero-outdoor-selfie.jpg`
**Replace with:** The outdoor selfie photo (second attachment)

## 4. Plane/Travel Selfie (Bottom-right rotated image)
**File:** `public/pictures/hero-plane-selfie.jpg`
**Replace with:** The airplane selfie photo (third attachment)

## How to Replace:
1. Save each photo from your attachments with the exact filename above
2. Copy them to the `public/pictures/` folder, replacing the existing files
3. The hero section will automatically update with your new photos

The images are already properly configured in the code - you just need to replace the placeholder files with your actual photos.
