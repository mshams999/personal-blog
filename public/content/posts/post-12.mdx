    """
    weighted_score = 0
    
    for item in user_data:
        relevance = calculate_relevance(item, preferences)
        popularity = get_popularity_score(item)
        
        # Weighted combination of factors
        score = (relevance * 0.7) + (popularity * 0.3)
        weighted_score += score
    
    return get_top_recommendations(weighted_score)
```
